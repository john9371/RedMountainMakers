            Since an important part of the maker space philosophy is trust, we want to get a sense of who you are.
            You will also want to evaluate our community to see if it's a good fit for you as well. This is why all members start out as basic members.
            Once you've been out for a few meetings, you can apply to become a Full Maker Membership.</div>
